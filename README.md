Neural network

The intent of this project:

1. Create a datamining and analysis toolset which is easily extensible through the addition of new modules.

2. Modules will allow the analysis of data through some toolset or add functionality to the program.
   i.e. a module can allow for the import or output of various source files or create a new way of analyzing input data.

3. Creating a generic neural network implementation or use an external library as the first module.

4. Should work on input from from local sources first, i.e. CSV files/excel, and then move onto input data from third party sources.

5. Getting up and running through console input would probably be the fastest way to get up and running first
   and then we can switch over to a gui environment onces we have a basis of code to interconnect.

6. Any additional thoughts/Ideas would be useful.
